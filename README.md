## Design

-   ### Colour Scheme

    -   The main colour scheme will be an off-blue colour with an overall dark feel to the site. White text will be used atop this dark background to ensure clear visibility of all text across all pages.
    - This colour scheme will provide a professional feel to the website as well as being easily accessible to all users.

-   ### Typography

    -   The main font used within the websites design will be Open Sans, with a fall-back font of Sans-Serif if the Open Sans font could not be loaded. The Open Sans font gives off a professional first impression.

-   ### Imagery

    -   The home page will be fitted with a fixed, scrollable background image that will have a dynamic blur effect applied as the user scrolls.
    -   Imagery will also be available in [popups](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-Popup.html) contained within the information displayed on the mapping pages.
